    <h1>Post configuration for minimal debian installation</h1>
<p>As I transitioned to Debian with a minimal installation paired with the XFCE desktop environment, I realized the importance of enhancing my system for a more comprehensive user experience. While the initial minimal setup laid the foundation, I found it necessary to install additional packages to fine-tune and optimize my Debian environment. This collection of notes not only serves as a guide to replicate my current configuration but also acts as a reference for future improvements. The integration of XFCE, along with carefully chosen packages, strikes a balance between efficiency and functionality, ensuring a smooth and personalized Debian experience. I created some notes that gets into essential packages and configurations, making it a handy resource for anyone seeking to configure Debian with XFCE at an intermediate to advanced level of proficiency.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer: The following packages are customized to my taste. Feel free, and encouraged, to adjust them to your preferences.</strong></p>
<h2>1. Installing XFCE Desktop Environment</h2>
<p>Once you complete the Debian installation from your USB/CD without selecting any desktop environment, you will need to configure it yourself. Start by installing the essential components for a minimal XFCE desktop environment. Open a terminal and execute:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>sudo<span class="w"> </span>apt<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>libxfce4util<span class="w"> </span>thunar<span class="w"> </span>xfce4-session<span class="w"> </span>xfce4-settings<span class="w"> </span>xfconf<span class="w"> </span>xfdesktop<span class="w"> </span>xfwm4<span class="w"> </span>urxvt-unicode
</code></pre></div>

<ul>
<li><code>libxfce4util</code> - It includes various helper functions and macros used by other XFCE components.</li>
<li><code>Thunar</code> - Thunar provides a user-friendly interface for managing files and directories, with features like tabbed browsing, bulk renaming, and file previews. It is the default GUI file manager for XFCE</li>
<li><code>xfce4-session</code> - Manages the user sessions, handling the startup and termination of applications and managing the overall session settings.</li>
<li><code>xfce4-settings</code> - Allows users to configure various settings for the XFCE desktop environment, including display, keyboard, mouse, and more.</li>
<li><code>xfconf</code> - Stores and retrieves application configuration settings. It is a key-value configuration system used by various XFCE components.</li>
<li><code>xfdesktop</code> - Manages the desktop background, icons, and provides basic desktop management functions.</li>
<li><code>xfwm4</code> - Manages window placement, decorations, and handles basic window management functions within the XFCE desktop environment.</li>
<li><code>urxvt-unicode</code> - Provides a lightweight terminal emulator with support for Unicode, suitable for use within the XFCE environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>These packages collectively form the core components necessary for a functional and lightweight XFCE desktop environment on a Debian system. They handle various aspects of the desktop user experience, ranging from file management to window handling and configuration settings.</p>
<h2>2. Granting Sudo Access</h2>
<p>I discovered that my created profile is not part of the <code>sudoers</code> group, preventing me from using any other commands relevant to the <code>root</code> user for further configurations.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>su<span class="w"> </span>-
usermod<span class="w"> </span>-aG<span class="w"> </span>sudo<span class="w"> </span>&lt;username&gt;
</code></pre></div>

<h2>3. Configuring existing SSH keys</h2>
<p>I typically store my private keys in a secure location, ensuring continued access when switching systems by creating backups. Place your private keys in the <code>~/.ssh</code> directory. If you haven't used the default names, remember to add them manually after each reboot, or include them in your <code>.bashrc</code> for automatic loading.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>ssh-add<span class="w"> </span>~/.ssh/&lt;key&gt;
</code></pre></div>

<h2>4. GUI WiFi Manager</h2>
<p>If you configured your WiFi during installation, you likely have internet access. However, changing connection settings currently requires using command-line commands, which may not be convenient if done infrequently. XFCE includes <code>nm-applet</code>, a tool that simplifies network configuration. Unfortunately, I encountered issues enabling it, necessitating manual editing of the Network Manager configuration.</p>
<p>Begin by removing your previously configured network from <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code>. Subsequently, modify the <code>/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf</code> file to set it as 'managed':</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">[main]</span>
<span class="na">plugins</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">ifupdown,keyfile</span>

<span class="k">[ifupdown]</span>
<span class="na">managed</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">true</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Reboot the system.</p>
<h2>5. Audio Manager</h2>
<p>To commence listening to audio, it is essential to install the basic packages enabling configuration of sound input and output. I recommend using <code>pulseaudio</code> as it usually suffices for this purpose.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>sudo<span class="w"> </span>apt<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>pulseaudio
</code></pre></div>

<h2>6. Bluetooth Manager</h2>
<p>I typically use my AirPods with the Linux system. The Bluetooth manager is not included by default in the minimal installation. To set it up, you need to download <code>blueman</code> or any other GUI manager. Alternatively, if you prefer, you can stick to the command line (CLI). 😊</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>sudo<span class="w"> </span>apt<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>bluetooth<span class="w"> </span>pulseaudio-module-bluetooth<span class="w"> </span>blueman<span class="w"> </span>bluez-firmware<span class="w"> </span>bluewho
</code></pre></div>

<ul>
<li><code>bluetooth</code> - Essential Bluetooth utilities and tools for managing Bluetooth devices.</li>
<li><code>pulseaudio-module-bluetooth</code> - PulseAudio extension module enabling seamless integration of Bluetooth audio devices.</li>
<li><code>blueman</code> - GTK-based Bluetooth manager with a user-friendly graphical interface.</li>
<li><code>bluez-firmware</code> - Firmware package for the BlueZ Bluetooth stack.</li>
</ul>
<h2>7. Touchpad click</h2>
<p>Since I use a laptop for my daily activities, I am accustomed to using touchpad taps to click on items. To enable this functionality, you need to add a few configurations.</p>
<p>based on this <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/337008/activate-tap-to-click-on-touchpad">thread</a>.
In the file <code>/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/40-libinput.conf</code> add</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Section &quot;InputClass&quot;
        Identifier &quot;touchpad catchall&quot;
        Driver &quot;synaptics&quot;
        MatchIsTouchpad &quot;on&quot;
        Option &quot;TapButton1&quot; &quot;1&quot;
        Option &quot;TapButton2&quot; &quot;3&quot;
</code></pre></div>

<p>Reboot the system.</p>
<h2>8. The keyring</h2>
<p>When attempting to log in to my GitHub account to sync settings on VSCode, I encountered an error related to the keyring application. It appears that XFCE lacks a dedicated tool to store secrets on the device. A possible solution is to reuse one from GNOME.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>sudo<span class="w"> </span>apt<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>gnome-keyring
</code></pre></div>

<h3>Keyring prompt</h3>
<p>If you set up a password for the keyring, you will be prompted to enter it every time you restart the machine. There's a suggestion <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/324843/chrome-harasses-me-for-a-keychain-password-at-startup">here</a> to set them blank. While it may not sound ideal, it is a workaround for the issue.</p>
<h2>9. Snap store</h2>
<p>I enjoy installing a few apps from the Snap Store, which are not available by default. To install them:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>sudo apt install snapd
sudo snap install core
sudo snap install snap-store
</code></pre></div>

<h3>Adding snap do appfinder</h3>
<p>It would be beneficial to have those installed apps also in the XFCE <code>appfinder</code>. To achieve this, simply add symbolic links to the applications.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>ln<span class="w"> </span>-s<span class="w"> </span>/var/lib/snapd/desktop/<span class="w"> </span>~/.local/share/applications/
</code></pre></div>

<p>I attempted to set the environmental path where <code>appfinder</code> is supposed to look for applications, but so far, I haven't had any success.</p>
<h2>10. Emojis</h2>
<p>When I started browsing the internet, I noticed that some emojis were not displaying correctly; instead, I saw black blocks. This issue can be resolved by downloading the <code>noto-color-emoji</code> fonts.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>sudo<span class="w"> </span>apt<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>fonts-noto-color-emoji
</code></pre></div>
