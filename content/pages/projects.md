List of side projects I created to tinker with and _maybe_ to improve my workflow in daily work.

### [fan-controller-for-co2-sensor](https://mateuszmyalski.github.io/fan-controller-for-co2-sensor.html)
Piece of hardware to turn on and off a fan to sink out fumes from my central heating system.

### [thinkpad-keybacklight](https://github.com/MateuszMyalski/thinkpad-keybacklight)
This repository provides a controller for managing the backlight of ThinkPad keyboards with integrated Systemd support. The controller offers extensive features including event-based backlight control, automatic brightness adjustments, and scheduling. This tool is especially useful for users who want to fine-tune their keyboard backlight settings based on input events, time, or system state.

### [hungry-birds](https://github.com/MateuszMyalski/hungry-birds)
Experience a unique way of browsing the internet with 'Hungry-Birds'! Watch as birds peck away at your screen, obscuring your view. But don't worry, by holding the 'Alt' key and shaking your cursor, you can startle them away, giving you a chance to glimpse the content beneath. It's a fun and whimsical twist on web browsing that adds an element of surprise and delight to your online adventures!

### [logseq-plugin-shallow-copy](https://github.com/MateuszMyalski/logseq-plugin-shallow-copy)
The Block Shallow Copy plugin empowers users with a seamless copying experience, allowing them to duplicate a selected block along with all its child blocks, limited to a depth of one level. This feature proves invaluable when you need to replicate a specific section of content, preserving its hierarchical structure effortlessly.

### [socket-terminal](https://github.com/MateuszMyalski/socket-terminal)
Simple telnet server for connecting IOT devices in e.g. star topology. Build for Debian tested on WSL2. The server has already implemented few basic commands.
Well, build mostly to leverage my knowledge in C++ and socket connections.

### [fsfs-emulator](https://github.com/MateuszMyalski/fsfs-emulator)
Another project I decided to publish mostly for learning purposes. Emulator of creating custom file system, just to better understand what are the problems and possibilities to store data in the memory.

---

### [windows-gopher-client](https://github.com/MateuszMyalski/windows-gopher-client)
For the time I used Windows there was no "gopher" protocol browser (for anyone that is not familiar with this dinosaur [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol))). I decided to write simple one in Python just to not use some web-browser based proxy that has difficulties in working smoothly.

### [feed-the-birds](https://github.com/MateuszMyalski/feed-the-birds)
Some tinkering with JavaScript to show some animated birds made out of two triangles. Feed them by pressing on the screen.
